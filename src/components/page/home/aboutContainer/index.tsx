                        We, at Samagati, aspire to promote Gap Culture through
                        Experiential Learning. We conduct a series of
                        experiments to promote gap culture in the form of gap
                        days, weeks, months, and years. Shortly, we plan to
                        instill this ideology around the nation and subsequently
                        throughout the globe.
